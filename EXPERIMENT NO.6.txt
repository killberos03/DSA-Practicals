EXPERIMENT NO:6

Department of Artificial Intelligence has student's club named ‘SAAI’. Students of Second, third and final year of department can be granted membership on request. Similarly one may cancel the membership of club. First node is reserved for president of club and last node is reserved for secretary of club. Write program to maintain club member‘s information using singly linked list. Store student MIS registration no. and Name. Write functions to a) Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary. b) Compute total number of members of club c) Display members.
